Fullstack project regarding a Hotel Propery Management System, utilizing Django.
This project is a contract with an external hotel owner who has requested me to create a website for his hotel's day to day needs.
It also is part of my Capstone Project for me to conclude my undergraduate studies.
It is currently being supported by SQLite, will move on to PostgreSQL, later on in the development process.
What still needs consideration is the payment process, the currency that will be used along with its final deployment in the hotel.
